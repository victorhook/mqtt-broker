# MQTT Broker
MQTT is (imho) a really interesting protocol that runs on TCP/IP.
This repository aims to implements a fully functional MQTT-broker that runs with Python.


## Purpose
The purpose of the project was mainly for an iot-course where I decided to use MQTT as the middle-man between the node sensors and the backend server. Even though I could definetely just install a complete broker, like mosquitto, I'd rather build one myself to really learn the protocol.

## What I've learned
